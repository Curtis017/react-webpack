# React Webpack
This project stems from the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator [generator-react-webpack](https://github.com/react-webpack-generators/generator-react-webpack#readme). It is meant to be a starting place for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) applications built with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). I have modified the original configuration to compile [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/guide) files and run [PostCSS](http://postcss.org) with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). I have also modified the build process in order to directly map images and css files with the relative path of the project.
